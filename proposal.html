    <p style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial; line-height: 200%;"  >Theatre is a general term for the performing arts on the stage that use language, movement, dance, music and other forms to achieve a narrative purpose. According to different criteria, theatre is also classified into various categories, the common ones include drama, musical theatre, comedy, tragedy, improvisation and so on. As a theatre lover in mainland China, I have been facing a frustration in recent years: as different theatre companies work with different ticketing platforms, only by following multiple platforms (e.g. websites, apps) can audiences acquire all the basic information about the latest local shows, such as show descriptions, times, venues, actors, ticket prices, etc. Nowadays, people can easily search for a theater or movie on platforms such as Dianping and Cat's Eye Movies to complete a series of actions from knowing about the film, confirming the schedule and purchasing tickets. As a relatively niche form of entertainment, theatre has room for improvement in terms of audiences-facing services.
        Based on this, this proposal summarizes the problems to be addressed as follows.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial;">Topic</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial;" >Theatre Activities in Shenzhen.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial;" >Target Users</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial;line-height: 200%;" >This website is targeted at theatre lovers in Shenzhen who are accustomed to using the Internet to obtain information on theatre activities.
       </p>
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial;line-height: 200%;" >In addition, I supposed that it would be beneficial to expand the theatre market in the mainland by making the website more interesting and convenient to attract audiences who had never seen a theatre before. However, at this early stage of the website’s establishment, I decide to focus on the existing theatre lovers and consider the expansion of audience base as part of the future development plan of the website.
